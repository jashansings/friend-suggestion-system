# 👥 Friend Suggestion System Using Graph Algorithms

This project is built under **Seasons of Code 2025** at **IIT Bombay**, mentored by [Mradul Sonkar](https://github.com/mradul-001).

A minimal full-stack web application that recommends friends to users based on their connections, powered by graph algorithms.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔹 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com-jashan:jashansings/friend-suggestion-system.git
cd friend-suggestion-system
```

---

### 🔹 2. Run the Frontend (React + Vite)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend will be live at: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

---

### 🔹 3. Run the Backend (FastAPI)

```bash
cd backend
# Create virtual environment if needed
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Backend runs on: [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)
